"It’s a smaller group of people"
"I really love how caring the staff has been. I have never really felt invested in by a pastor the way I have with Dwight and Mindy (and Bill too!). They are so genuine and I never feel like they are just putting on a face. I love that the Bible is preached and that people in leadership are living lives that reflect Jesus. I also love the upbeat, current music! "

"Being here most of my life, I have limited exposure to other churches. That said I appreciate the generosity of people. They are generous with their kindness, prayer support, finances, time and talents. This church has always had a priority of preaching God’s word. We strive to stay in line with God’s teaching and His will. This body of believers has a strong foundation. We don’t get caught up in compromising the Word to try and “fit in”  so as to attract people to us. We try to focus on God so that they will be attracted to Him. "

"I think you are asking, what aspect do I like at this church that I didn't find at other churches.  (Why did I choose to attend this church?)  If that is the question - when we started attending there was a thriving young adults/young married group of strong Christians that was a great draw.  We looked forward to seeing all our friends and sharing life with other believers.  We haven't visited too many other churches since starting to attend."
"It is familiar."
