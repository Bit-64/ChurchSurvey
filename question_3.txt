"more active in the community and more activities for youth"

"Options for small or life groups. Good communication about the life of the church. "
"I have liked other churches that have very cutting edge and engaging worship services, and it is something I feel we are still lacking in. Other successful churches I have been to have had really impactful, forward-thinking pastors with action-oriented messages. That is never something we have had here that I would love to see."
Nothing
"An altar call at the end of the service for those who need to give their life to Jesus. Also I feel that the pastor needs to give messages about the times we are living in and prepare the people for the return of Jesus. The people need to know that we are living in the end of the end days and that Jesus is coming back for His bride SOON.  They need to know that they need to repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. He is coming for a bride who is without spot, wrinkle or blemish.  I want a pastor who is on FIRE for the Lord and who preaches repentance!!"
