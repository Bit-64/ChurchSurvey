In addition, his lifestyle reflects his relationship with Christ. It seems that this is a given for a Church of God pastor but unfortunately it isn't always the case. I think my biggest vote for him comes because my youngest is extra excited to come when she knows Dwight is preaching. He's extremely relatable to the younger generations.

People pouring into others and discipleship - sermons continuing to be based solely on the word and how we can apply it to our lives - continue to have great current music - maybe even an updated sanctuary to be more attractive to younger generations (but that is just extra) and if I may be so bold, I would love for Dwight to be the lead pastor! ","Yes I would! I think there is a great community, great leaders, awesome worship and the teaching is always straight from the word. ","I think you guys have been doing such a great job and I am excited to see who you find to be our pastor! This church is such a wonderful place and I feel a lot of it is the people who are a part of it. But definitely consider Dwight! He is such a great leader and so genuine. I think he would do such a great job! He is a living example of who we are called to be - he isn't perfect yet he is striving to live a godly life. God is using him to show us He doesn't want perfect, He just wants us to be who He created and called us to be. I think that Christians feel they have to appear perfect all the time, so having a lead pastor that shows its okay not to be perfection is so refreshing!  I would take a personable loving pastor over a well spoken preacher any day! 

Thank you all for all of the time you are devoting to this search! I have been and will be praying for you as you search for the best candidates! I know you will pick/find someone perfect for us. Have a great day!"

The people need to know that we are living in the end of the end days and that Jesus is coming back for His bride SOON.  They need to know that they need to repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. He is coming for a bride who is without spot, wrinkle or blemish.  I want a pastor who is on FIRE for the Lord and who preaches repentance!!",fellowship community;location;love of preaching,reaching younger generation;outreach and evangelism;preaching,discipleship;church growth,"It would be wonderful if there is a pastor who is a strong leader with a passion for God who wants to see people grow in Christ. I pray it will be someone who stands on faith and God's word alone and does not conform to what the world wants.  I would also love to see our outreach ministries resume again with feeding the hungry and visiting the sick, and reaching the youth and the lost for Christ. ","If we're talking about before the fake plandemic, then yes I would.  But if we're talking about now, then unfortunately no not in it's current state. I used to recommend it but sadly not anymore.  I pray that God removes the scales from people's eyes and they see the truth and the truth sets them free. Sadly, as I see it right now this church is dying and some would say it is already a dead church with dry bones in need of revival. I pray daily for this church and for the congregation and it is my hope that it comes back to life with the fire of the Holy Spirit.  ","Please try to find someone who can lead the youth. We really need a youth director who can lead them to Christ and teach them, not to play games, but to actually learn about Christ and how to have a relationship with him. There needs to be Sunday School for the youth also where they have lessons and learn, not hang out and sit around, but to learn and be taught from the Bible. "

(Why did I choose to attend this church?)  If that is the question - when we started attending there was a thriving young adults/young married group of strong Christians that was a great draw.  We looked forward to seeing all our friends and sharing life with other believers.  We haven't visited too many other churches since starting to attend.",Genuine community outreach,love of music,reaching younger generation;building community;outreach and evangelism,young families;missions and outreach,"With a new pastor, I am hoping to see significant growth in the young family segment.",Yes.
