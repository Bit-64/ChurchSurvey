In addition, his lifestyle reflects his relationship with Christ. It seems that this is a given for a Church of God pastor but unfortunately it isn't always the case.

God is using him to show us He doesn't want perfect, He just wants us to be who He created and called us to be. I think that Christians feel they have to appear perfect all the time, so having a lead pastor that shows its okay not to be perfection is so refreshing!
