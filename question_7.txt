"LOVING FAMILY, DISCIPLESHIPLING PEOPLE WITH GODS WORD NOT THE WORLDS VIEW"
"I hope we get the Sunday School program going again, and attract young families.  That builds the church.  A young minister with a family would be ideal.  "
"hoping for growth older people are passing on"
"In a place that caters towards both the younger & older generations effectively."

"Hopefully back to normal!ðŸ˜Š I'd love to see growth in the kids/youth/young adult areas. Overall growth would be good but not at the expense of losing the community, pastoral care and teaching of Biblical truths.  I'd love to see a series on discipleship for all ages and opportunities to go out and practice what we've learned. I'd also love to see an all church mentorship program (from seniors to kids) where each generation one on one mentors another in growing in our faith and reaching our fullest potential for Christ. "

"Iâ€™m not sure"
"I would love to have a thriving children's, youth and young adult's ministry (what we have now is great but I would love to see it grow and be able to reach more kids!) - small groups for people to get plugged in, and would really emphasize growth and accountability! People pouring into others and discipleship - sermons continuing to be based solely on the word and how we can apply it to our lives - continue to have great current music - maybe even an updated sanctuary to be more attractive to younger generations (but that is just extra) and if I may be so bold, I would love for Dwight to be the lead pastor! "
"This depends on the Pastor that is chosen.  I really like they way Pastor Dwight delivers the message."
"Iâ€™m not sure"
"About the same."
"large congregation and more active members within the church"
"Would like to see a bigger congregation ,  I feel like everyone is looking for new church and don't understand why."
"If the new pastor can bring unity I think we will a booming church"
"A strong presence, identity in the community. Known for a place to belong, a place to come to with oneâ€™s needs. Growing thru evangelism. Discipling new converts. Training up leaders. Running outreach/missions full tilt without limitations of resources. "

"All aspects of our church have grown, ie small groups, youth, children ministry"
"Filled with more people of all ages. Excitement and positive attitudes. "
"In five years I would like to see this church flip its focus from prioritizing the wants of the people regularly in the pews to prioritizing the people that have yet to visit us and focus on the new faces that do come in our doors. There should be a clear and established pathway for new people to fit into the mold and get involved with the church. I'd like to see the church establish and communicate a solid vision and tangible goals to the congregation. In five years, we can easily establish core pillars of faith and communicate what it means to be a part of the HHCOG community. Relationship building and deeper spiritual development can certainly be tangible in our congregation over the next five years with the development of a strong adult small group program and discipleship programs."
"Continual growth in all aspects of the church"
"It would be wonderful if there is a pastor who is a strong leader with a passion for God who wants to see people grow in Christ. I pray it will be someone who stands on faith and God's word alone and does not conform to what the world wants.  I would also love to see our outreach ministries resume again with feeding the hungry and visiting the sick, and reaching the youth and the lost for Christ. "
