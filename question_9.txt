"clear, applicable Bible teaching"
"A pastor who preaches through the spirit of the Lord and not be constricted by the clock."
"A person who will keep your mind on the sermon in a spiritual and joyful way."
"Someone with vision and drive, not just filling a role.   Truly called to ministry not just finding it is a job to do."
"Think outside the box. Don’t limit your search to geographical area, Economics,  denomination, or Church of God credentials. I have not been impressed with a number of Church of God Credentialed  Pastors. I do believe some Seminary experience would be helpful. I do believe the new pastor needs to have a fair knowledge of Social Media Tools. The pastor wife needs to be active in the ministry. Our past two pastors wife’s did not play a significant role in the congregation. Most of all he needs to be a strong leader not just a manager. He should be able to lead the various committees not just follow their direction."
"Giving Pastor Dwight position"
"I'm praying for you"
"Pastor Dwight is my choose"
"SOMEONE I COULD TALK TO AND KNOW IT WAS KEPTED TO THEMSELVES AND ARE NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON THE HOT TOPICS OF THE WORLD FROM GODS WORD. SOMEONE THAT KNOWS THE WORD OF GOD AND DOES NOT MISS USE IT TO FIT THERE MASSAGE AND WOULD MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE AFTER CHURCH FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION. SOMEONE WHOSE FAMILY WOULD BECOME PART OF THE CHURCH FAMILY AND MY FAMILY A PASTOR NOT A PREACHER, A LEADER NOT A BOSS"
"Someone who would be able to get the different age groups to work together.  We now have a wonderful leader for the Young at Heart, but the other groups need a leader, so we can all help each other.  A minister who can relate to all age groups would be a real blessing.  "

"I feel like I really connect best when Pastor Dwight preaches versus other pastors that have preached to me because he keeps my attention by being versatile and using visual props as well as bringing in real life situations to his sermons. He is also very relatable and down to earth which helps."
"It was nice years past to have Easter, Christmas specials. "

"Honestly, we love Dwight. Coming from a large church, it is so refreshing to hear real, not perfect but loaded with scripture sermons from someone who genuinely cares about the people. In addition, his lifestyle reflects his relationship with Christ. It seems that this is a given for a Church of God pastor but unfortunately it isn't always the case. I think my biggest vote for him comes because my youngest is extra excited to come when she knows Dwight is preaching. He's extremely relatable to the younger generations. She sees him as real, genuinely caring about her and encouraging her to keep digging deeper and that to me is priceless! My prayers are with you all as you seek God's will in this! Thanks for your time!"

"Whoever the committee decide to be our next pastor. Please make sure the individual is driven to move our church forward in reaching the next generation but most importantly, not forgetting our elderly, who are the heritage of our church."

"I think you guys have been doing such a great job and I am excited to see who you find to be our pastor! This church is such a wonderful place and I feel a lot of it is the people who are a part of it. But definitely consider Dwight! He is such a great leader and so genuine. I think he would do such a great job! He is a living example of who we are called to be - he isn't perfect yet he is striving to live a godly life. God is using him to show us He doesn't want perfect, He just wants us to be who He created and called us to be. I think that Christians feel they have to appear perfect all the time, so having a lead pastor that shows its okay not to be perfection is so refreshing!  I would take a personable loving pastor over a well spoken preacher any day! Thank you all for all of the time you are devoting to this search! I have been and will be praying for you as you search for the best candidates! I know you will pick/find someone perfect for us. Have a great day!"
"I would put Pastor Dwight in first place. He knows the church.  Get an assistant pastor to help him that can minister to the young people also."

"I would love to see Pastor Dwight become the next pastor."
"I would like Pastor Dwight will be our Pastor, he is knows better than nobody else the church and the people I think the committee should look for a youth pastor not for a Senior Pastor, I think he is the best for our church.  Why to bring a stranger to our church when we already have the best of the best , he is the one."
"It is important to understand what everyone ""needs"".  It is also good to remember that we cannot be all things to all people.  Keep before you what God wants for this church.  Perhaps that isn't the same as what the current congregation wants."
"Seek and know the will of God for whom He is calling to us. This first and foremost. God knows us best and knows what is best for us better than we can ever surmise."
"Our next pastor should have the support of a spouse who is willing to also be part of ministering to our church and to our community. This pastor should have a special gift for connecting with people of all ages, and be willing/able to draw younger families to HHCOG."
"We  already have a great choice in Dwight Bruggeman (and his family)."
""
"Dwight Bruggleman to be the pastor ! He has many gifts that the church can use to become a more vibrant, compassionate, caring church!"
"Three times we have asked a pastor to pray over someone in our family.  The first time they agreed, then when Sunday came they forgot.  The second and third time we asked, we never got a response back.  This past week a pastor posted on Facebook James 5:14.  We did this, and it didn't happen."
"Age 35-45 and have a family with some kids still at home."

"To find a minister that is down to earth and preaches directly from the bible"
"Age of a pastor does not always matter. An older pastor can grow the church and reach young families. A younger pastor can minister to the elderly. Let's not leave the elderly behind. "
"Please do not be clouded by self-righteousness. Read Luke 18:9-14."
"Next preacher to use bible to preach to what happens in daily life"
"Please try to find someone who can lead the youth. We really need a youth director who can lead them to Christ and teach them, not to play games, but to actually learn about Christ and how to have a relationship with him. There needs to be Sunday School for the youth also where they have lessons and learn, not hang out and sit around, but to learn and be taught from the Bible. "
"I'm praying for you"
"The importance of the healthy growth of a kingdom building community"
"Someone who can attract young families but also minister to the more mature believers"
"I would like to see a plan for personal commitment (small groups?) and to get back to a ""church family"" atmosphere that was so evident many years ago, i.e. a sense of belonging and genuine concern for others through normal daily interactions and a blending of all age groups.  "
"Someone who is not afraid of being political incorrect.  Someone who called a spade a spade and without any apologies."
